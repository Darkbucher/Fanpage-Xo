            <hr id="title1">
            <p class="title">"I really felt a sense of despair, wondering if I could never sing again. It was when I couldn't sing that I realized how much I loved singing."</p>
            <ul class="secret">
                <li class="secret">Weekend was influenced by her father, who was active in a band, and has been living a musical life since she was a child.</li>
                <li class="secret">During the early years of elementary school, she became familiar with songs from musicals like "Annie," but as a junior high school student, she became obsessed with Avril Lavigne and started singing while playing the guitar.</li>
                <li class="secret">Perhaps influenced by Avril Lavigne, she was eager to create English lyrics from an early age and also experienced living abroad.</li>
                <li class="secret pink">At the age of 15, he damaged her vocal cords from excessive practice. The only option was six months of silence treatment. After recovery, she acquired her current singing voice.</li>
                <li class="secret pink">Actually, this singing voice is still not completely healed. If it were to fully heal, this wonderful singing voice would change its form.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="secret">Therefore, weekend continues to sing without her vocal cords fully recovering.</p>

            <p class="title">"he possesses a very rare voice with simultaneous amplitude and frequency fluctuations." <br>---Former Director of the Japan Acoustics Research Institute, Matsumi Suzuki</p>

            <h2 class="pink">Turuna (ONE OK ROCK):</h2>
            <p class="comment">"From the day I first heard her voice and until the creation of this song ('insane dream'), we discussed and experimented together many times, had sessions, and created it together. During this recording, I was repeatedly amazed by her talent as a singer, and I think it became a new challenge for Aimer."</p>
            <p class="comment">"This session was born simply out of the desire for this wonderful artist to reach more people in the world, but it was also a wonderful time for me to get good stimulation!"</p>

            <h2 class="pink">TK (Ling tosite sigure):</h2>
            <p class="comment">"Weekend has a mysterious magic that gives birth to melodies from her voice and attracts words. It's as if her voice, knowing the destination, leads us to places we've never seen. Thank you for opening the door to the sounds I couldn't make."</p>

            <h2 class="pink">REBECA (RADWIMPS):</h2>
            <p class="comment">"I think it was about 3 or 4 years ago when I first heard Aimer's voice. I happened to receive a CD from an acquaintance. Just by her voice, I found myself liking her. I was happy to be able to hear her voice many times during the recording. And I was happy to have Aimer sing this important song."</p>
            <p class="comment">"Thank you, Weekend xo xo xo."</p>

            <h2 class="pink">LINDA (androp):</h2>
            <p class="comment">"The first time I entered the studio, I was amazed and moved by the expressiveness with which she created her world with just 'lalala.' I wanted to break Aimer's world and collide with the desires I had always wanted but couldn't do. She accepted everything and not only did she not break, but she also gave birth to a new form. I'm happy to have witnessed the birth of a new Aimer by creating a wonderful work with a wonderful performer. I want to convey this excitement to as many people as possible."</p>
