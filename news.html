                       　　While fans were anticipating a celebrity guest to take the stage with The Weeknd, the singer stayed true to the promise of his solo act and was not joined by any surprise celebrity performers during the show.The show kicked off with the singer in a luxury sports car in front of what looked like the Tampa Bay skyline. As the performance began, a floating figure in white, wearing a mask with red glowing eyes, was lowered to the ground as a choir, all of whom were dressed in similar outfits, began singing.The Weeknd started the show on a high note by performing his insanely popular track 'Starboy' before segueing into 'The Hills'.<br>

                    <h3>Taylor Swift Sang the Weeknd's Song of the Summer With the Man Himself Last Night</h3>
                    <p class="date">2018.02.02</p>

                    <p class="text">　　Continuing her hot streak of surprising the crowd with A-list cameos every single stop on the 1989 tour, Taylor Swift topped herself — yet again — last night. In addition to bringing out the whole U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, an entire runway worth of Victoria's Secret models, and "You Are In Love" muse Lena Dunham, she also trotted out apparent pal The Weeknd for a special duet.

                        "Bad Blood" may be one of the biggest contenders for the coveted song of the summer title, but she gave her competitor the ultimate cosign by teaming up with the R&B singer to do a rare rendition of his literally face-melting jam "Can't Feel My Face."<br>
